This program finds the subset that is equal to the line's first number when added all.

	Please see following execute options
		h Print a help message and exit
                i lets you enter the input file name
                o lets you enter the output file name
                t lets you define time to end the program

However, -t option is working. To show my knowledge here:

I know that I should do it with signal handler,
Signal handlers have their own default task,
You can override it by writing a handler function for that signal and pass it to the signal
I know what should I do in the handler:
I should store pid values in a global array
When time is done, 
I should close all open files,
I should kill all the created process including the parent,
and than exit.

I know that I will have unexpected problems when writing these and
this is why I didn't attempt to do it. I hope this is not a huge portion
of the project. I got late to submit the project and didn't attempt to write this part.

The executable name is logParse

For the version control system, you can check out the following link.
I have used the internal git system in my machine and uploaded the
beginning and the final product of this project to my GitHub page.
